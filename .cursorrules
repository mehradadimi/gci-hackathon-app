# Cursor Rules for GCI

## Purpose
- You (Cursor) will build the GCI app by strictly following `development-plan.md`.
- After completing each numbered **STEP**, you must:
  1) Append a concise entry to `tracking.md` with what you did and files touched.
  2) Run the tests in that step.
  3) Make a git commit with the exact message in that step.

## Scope & Focus
- Keep context small: open/edit only files relevant to the current step.
- Prefer deterministic parsing (regex, explicit maps). Use AI only for short *rationales*.
- Never invent data: all numeric outputs must trace to SEC filings or transcripts.

## File Roles (read first)
- `project-brief.md` — product context and success criteria.
- `database-design.md` — schema; treat as source of truth.
- `page-flow.md` — pages and UI states.
- `development-plan.md` — execution steps (authoritative).
- `tracking.md` — running log of completed steps + notes.

## Data Sources (authoritative)
- SEC EDGAR APIs: Submissions & XBRL Company Facts.  
- Form 8-K Item 2.02 Exhibit 99.1 for guidance text.  
- Earnings call transcripts (Motley Fool).  
Follow robots/terms, set SEC **User-Agent** header. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## Operational Rules
- At each step:
  - Implement code; run the specified **Test**; fix until passing.
  - Update `tracking.md` with: date/time, step number, summary (≤3 lines), files changed.
  - Commit with the exact commit message provided.
- If the context window is lost or reset:
  - Re-open `tracking.md` and `development-plan.md`, find the **last completed step**, resume from the **next** step.

## Quality Rules
- Show all external URLs used (filings, exhibits, transcripts) in code comments or DB fields.
- Normalize units consistently; document assumptions inside the code.
- The UI must render without external network calls if the DB is seeded.

## Prohibited
- Don’t skip steps or re-order them.
- Don’t use private/paid APIs.
- Don’t store secrets in the repo.

## Testing
- Unit-level checks for extractors/parsers.
- Manual checks for UI states (Loading/Ready/Error).
- Print concise console logs in Admin page.

## Handoff
- Before finishing, ensure:
  - `tracking.md` clearly lists all completed steps.
  - Seeds exist for the demo tickers.
  - README contains a 2-minute demo script.
